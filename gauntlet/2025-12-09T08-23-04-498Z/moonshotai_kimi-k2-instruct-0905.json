  "summary": "Apex predator of logistics efficiency. 15+ years architecting zero-downtime dispatch systems for 60+ daily fuel-equivalent moves across CA/NV. Built automation that slashed scheduling latency 30% and guarantees 99% on-time delivery. Now turning that same surgical precision to fuel dispatch, inventory monitoring, and carrier orchestration—because trucks, dollars, and gallons all move on my command.",
